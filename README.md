## Functionality Features:
* Classic Calculator Functionality including operators of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. 
* Clear Entry (CE) and Clear (C) operations

## Program Arithmetic Logic:
* Calculator deals with operations in pairs. Each operation is carried out, the result is displayed, then additional operations can be performed on this result. 
* 5 + 10 - 9 deals with this entry from left to right first displaying 15 then displaying 6


## Design Features:
* Color matched colors from original calculator image using gimp and then implemented colors in web app. 
* Custom Calculator font for digital display
* Custom colored Texas Instruments Logo to match original calculator

## Moving Forward:
* Simplify logic for calculator instead of current algorithm creating an array and using linear search to find operators with splice modifications on data 
*  Add Percent functionality
*  Improve divide by 0 error management to display an alert and remove the zero array entry 
*  Mobile Support
*  UI Improvements like shadows to calculator to create depth and key press sounds
